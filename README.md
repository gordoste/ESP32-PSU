# ESP32-PSU
A general purpose ESP32 breakout board, optimised for lab instrument control, and a single channel hybrid power supply module.

Two separate versions of the Open Weather code are provided for the 2.8" and 3.5" display options. They should be compiled and loaded using your own OWM token. https://openweathermap.org/appid

The Laser Templates folder has SVG files for the front and rear panels of the power supply. There are separate versions for the 2.8" and 3.5" display options. In each front panel file there are two templates: the front panel itself (with colour coded cut [outlines] and etch [labels] elements) and a second template for a panel to support the display and controller PCBs (avoiding front panel screws). A reinforcing plate for the binding posts is also included. It is fitted behnd the front panel.

The front and supporting panels were cut from 2mm acrylic and the back panel from the plastic insert provided with the case.

The laser templates are designed for a Pro'skit 203-115B instrument case (Jaycar HB5910, Altronics H0482). The templates have been tested with LightBurn, but should work with other laser cutter software. 

My front panel was made with clear acrylic, coated on the BACK with black spray paint. Wood filler, in a contrasting colour, was squeegeed into the etched labels and then polished off with very fine DRY sandpaper (240 grit). A final coat of clear spray was then appled to seal the wood filler and restore a gloss finish to the acrylic.

These files relate to a project published in Silicon Chip magazine in 2021. https://www.siliconchip.com.au/
