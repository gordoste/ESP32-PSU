A general purpose ESP32 breakout board, optimised for lab instrument control, and a single channel hybrid power supply module.

Two separate versions of the Open Weather code are provided for the 2.8" and 3.5" display options. They should be compiled and loaded using your own OWM token. https://openweathermap.org/appid

The Laser Templates folder has SVG files for the front and rear panels of the power supply. An additional panel, which supports the display and controller PCBs, is included. All the templates are designed for a Pro'skit 203-115B instrument case (Jaycar HB5910, Altronics H0482). The templates have been tested with LightBurn, but should work with other laser cutter software.
